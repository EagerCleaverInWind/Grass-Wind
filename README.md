# Grass-Wind
grass wave in wind
## About This Demo
Grass in most games implemented with the billboard technology looks so ugly.What I prefer 
is that the grass with fixed orientation, show us the wind as the grass wave.So I drafted this demo.
## The Rendering Material
With the tessellation and geometry shader of DX11,it generates grass fully procedurally on any mesh,
which seems that the hair grows from the mesh!
